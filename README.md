##**Diabetes Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis**

This code performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Diabetes Dataset, exploring its distribution, outliers, and relationships between features. It begins by importing necessary libraries, reading the dataset as a Pandas DataFrame, and displaying its first few rows and summary statistics. Then, it checks for null values, duplicated values, and visualizes data distribution, outliers, and correlations. Additionally, the code applies standard scaling and label encoding to prepare the data for modeling. Afterward, it implements a K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier to evaluate the model's performance with varying values of k. Finally, it presents a confusion matrix and classification report to assess the model's accuracy and performance metrics.ï»¿
